# TensorFlow Study Notebooks 

This repo contains the TensorFlow implementation when I attend the corresponding lectures. Three networks are implemented:

1. 3-level Fully-Connected for MINIST dataset
2. VGG16 for CIFAR dataset
3. For the implementation of LSTM with Numpy please refer to [RNNAssignment](https://github.com/AnfangRobkit/RNNAssignment)
